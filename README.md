Osiris is your personal academia bot that thrives to make you become the best student. It analyzes all your active classes and gives you insights on how to improve in an intuitive manner. A simple click and go will give you a pathway to success. We believe that a social chatbot should be easy-going and personalized to each individual student, which is why we built OSIRIS. Osiris is built through electron.js for the slick graphical user interface and Java for the heavy-duty backend such as aggregating grades and data visualization.
